<h2>Pros & Cons of NIL</h2>
<p>Some pros of NIL are that student athlets no longer have to decide on how to make money and their athletic endavors and dreams. For a long time The NCAA has had players under its thumb making money off of these players without giving anything in return. NIL is helping players gain a little more respect and power back toward their likene. NIL is helpful beyond athletics as well such as helping athletes build their brands outside of sports, This allows them to receive an education and valuable college athletic experience while still possessing power over their ability to receive compensation for their work. After all they are putting their bodies on the line and risking their careers for their college. </p>    

<p>The NIL does have its cons such as Not all players can profit from NIL the same. High profile athletes at high profile universities may find substantial gain from NIL while athletes at smaller profile universities or colleges may not. This is one of the primary issues with NIL. The passing of the NIL policy may change the <a href="NILandrecruitment.html">recruiting</a> process and draw more players to well-known, high profile colleges and universities as these institutions likely have more pull and influence over NIL activities and deals even though the schools themselves cannot have any affiliation with NIL activities. Many emphasize the importance of allowing student-athletes to profit off of their NIL, it is crucial to recognize how this change does not alter, and arguably worsens, the working conditions of student-athletes. Life as a student-athlete is incredibly demanding--balancing practice, weight-training, watching film, attending classes, completing assignments, and having time for themselves and a social life. Establishing and upholding NIL deals requires more labor from student-athletes; they have to work to create the deals, cultivate a personal brand that is appealing to companies, establish a successful social media following, and post content for the company</p>
