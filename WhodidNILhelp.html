<h2>Pros & Cons of NIL</h2>
<p>Some pros of NIL are that student athlets no longer have to decide on how to make money and their athletic endavors and dreams. For a long time The NCAA has had players under its thumb making money off of these players without giving anything in return. NIL is helping players gain a little more respect and power back toward their likene. NIL is helpful beyond athletics as well such as helping athletes build their brands outside of sports, This allows them to receive an education and valuable college athletic experience while still possessing power over their ability to receive compensation for their work because after all they are putting their bodies on the line and risking their careers for their college. </p>
